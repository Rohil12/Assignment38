    "Imagine training a linear regression model with many features. Without regularization, the model may assign very high or low weights to features to minimize the training error, potentially overfitting the training data. With L2 regularization, the penalty term forces the model to keep the weights small, promoting a simpler model that generalizes better to new data.\"\"\""
